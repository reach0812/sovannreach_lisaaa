      My dearest love,<br><br>
      Loving you is the most real and beautiful part of my life. Every moment with you feels like a gift I never knew I deserved. Your presence fills my days with warmth, your smile lifts my spirit, and your love makes me a better person than I ever thought I could be.<br><br>
      Thank you, from the bottom of my heart, for choosing me every single day even when life is hard, even when I’ve made many mistakes that have disappointed you many times.. Thank you for your patience, your forgiveness, and your unwavering belief in us. Your love has taught me what it truly means to care for someone deeply, selflessly, and passionately.<br><br>
      I promise to cherish you, to listen, to laugh with you, and to hold your hand through every storm and every sunshine. I hope to be your safe place, your joy, and your constant, as you are mine. Every heartbeat of mine carries gratitude for you, and every thought of you brings a smile I can’t contain.<br><br>
      Happy Anniversary, my love. Here’s to all the memories we’ve made and the countless moments ahead. I am endlessly yours, and I will always choose you, just as you have chosen me.<br><br>
      ❤️ Forever and always
